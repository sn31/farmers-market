## Epicodus Project - React Fundamentals - November, 2018

## Description

Avery's Organics is a mid-sized farm in Northern Oregon that grows organic produce, and sells it at Farmer's Markets throughout town. Since they're at a different market almost every day they thought it would be helpful to start a website so customers can see which location they'll be at when.

They also grow different crops in different seasons. They'd like to display what produce is available during which months on their site too.
